The goal of this project is to better understand the __significance of certain features__ on a __property's price__ in the Perth Metropolitan Area (Western Australia), and conducting a comparison between __character homes__ and __new homes__. A home will be considered to be a character home if its year of construction was 1950 or earlier (guidelines for what constitutes a character home vary between city Councils, so having a common reference year will be used to simplify the analysis), and a new home is considered any home built after 1950.

Having worked in architecture for the last 5 years, it became clear that character homes can be (significantly) more expensive than newly built homes due to their historical significance, aesthetic character, and situation within established older suburbs. This study should help to substantiate this argument from a quantitative perspective using data.

The dataset being used was sourced from [Perth Housing Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/syuzai/perth-house-prices) which contains data and features scraped from [Home Sold Price](http://house.speakingsame.com/).

The repository contains both the raw, and preprocessed versions of the dataset. The former is used in the Jupyer notebook to show the pre-processing workflow, the latter is used for the Power BI analysis.
